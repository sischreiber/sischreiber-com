We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.\nOur privacy policy is structured as follows:\nI. Information about us as controllers of your data II. The rights of users and data subjects III. Information about the data processing\nI. Information about us as controllers of your data The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of data protection law is:\nSimon Schreiber Naupliastr. 118 München Telefon: 017621695725 E-Mail: simon@sischreiber.com\nThe controller’s data protection officer is:\n[DSB – Vorname, Nachname] Telefon: [DSB – Telefonnummer] Telefax: [DSB – Faxnummer] E-Mail: [DSB – E-Mail] [The following information must be added if an external data protection officer has been appointed]. [DSB-Extern – Straße, Hausnummer] [DSB-Extern – Postleitzahl, Ort] II. The rights of users and data subjects With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right\nto confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR); to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR); to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR; to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR); to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR). In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.\nLikewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.\nIII. Information about the data processing Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.\nCookie Manager To obtain consent for the use of technically unnecessary cookies on the website, the provider uses a cookie manager.\nWhen the website is called up, a cookie with the settings information is stored on the end device of the user so that the request for consent does not have to be made on a subsequent visit.\nThe cookie is required to obtain legally compliant user consent.\nYou can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your internet browser.\nCookies a) Session cookies We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address.\nThis processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.\nThe legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.\nIf the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.\nWhen you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.\nb) Third-party cookies If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.\nPlease refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.\nc) Disabling cookies You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.\nIf you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.\nGoogle Analytics We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).\nThe Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.\nUsage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.\nThe data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.\nGoogle states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at\nhttps://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,\nincluding options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.\nIn addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at\nhttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en\nin addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics‘ JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.\n","wordCount":"1348","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://sischreiber.com/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sischreiber.com/data/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Simon Schreiber | Product Management Consultant","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://sischreiber.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://sischreiber.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://sischreiber.com/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sischreiber.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Data</h1></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=privacy-policy>Privacy Policy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#privacy-policy>#</a></h1><p>Personal data (usually referred to just as „data“ below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p><p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“ refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p><p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others.

(Skelton \u0026 Pais)\nOne of the central theses is that software architectures and the way teams interact are closely connected. This can be attributed to Conway’s Law, which states that an organization’s communication structures influence its software architecture.\nThe Four Team Types At its core, the model outlines four team types, each with specific roles within the overall structure.\nStream-Aligned Teams Stream-aligned teams work end-to-end on a clearly defined value stream that is closely tied to customer needs or business goals. They act autonomously and are responsible for delivering a steady flow of valuable software. For example, a customer support portal team that develops a self-service solution for customer inquiries.\nComplicated Subsystem Teams Complicated subsystem teams take responsibility for software areas where significant expertise is required. Their goal is to provide a specialized subsystem to other teams and help them reduce their team cognitive load. An example could be a geodata team developing a high-precision mapping system for autonomous vehicles.\nEnabling Teams Enabling teams are helping other teams to close knowledge gaps or adopt new technologies. For example, a UX research enablement team coaches other teams in qualitative user research methods.\nPlatform Teams Platform teams provide tools and services for other teams. They act as internal service providers. An example is an identity \u0026 access management team that develops a central authentication and authorization solution for the entire organization.\nA crucial insight of Team Topologies is that the primary benefit of a platform is to reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned teams. (Martin Fowler)\nThe Three Interaction Modes In addition to the team types, there are three fundamental modes for how teams can efficiently interact:\nCollaboration Mode Teams collaborate closely to solve a specific challenge. For example, a stream-aligned team and a platform team collaborate to integrate a new API.\nFacilitating Mode One team supports another team without directly engaging in its tasks. Facilitation is particularly useful for sharing knowledge or improving workflows. For example, an agile coaching team coaches a stream-aligned team on kanban practices.\nX-as-a-Service Mode One team provides standardized tools or services that other teams can use in an x-as-a-service manner. For example, a machine learning team offers pre-trained models and an API to use for internal teams.\nReferences Team Topologies, Matthew Skelton \u0026 Manuel Pais https://github.com/TeamTopologies/miro-team-topologies https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html ","wordCount":"428","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-01-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Simon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/topologies/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Simon Schreiber | Product Management Consultant","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Team Topologies in a Nutshell With Examples</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 7, 2025</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>With Team Topologies, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais aim to reduce the complexity of tech organizations to four team types and three modes of interaction.</p><blockquote><p>The end goal is to help teams produce software that aligns with customer needs and is easier to build, run, and own.

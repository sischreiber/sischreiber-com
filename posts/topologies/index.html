One of the central theses is that software architectures and the way teams interact are closely connected.

This can be attributed to Conway’s Law, which states that an organization’s communication structures influence its software architecture.\nThe concept also incorporates approaches from cognitive load theory, Dunbar’s number and domain-driven design (DDD).\nThe Four Team Types in Team Topologies At its core, the model outlines four team types, each with specific roles within the overall structure. All visualizations show an example music streaming service.\nStream-Aligned Teams Stream-aligned teams work end-to-end on a clearly defined value stream that is closely tied to customer needs or business goals. They act autonomously and are responsible for delivering a steady flow of valuable software.\nFor example:\nA recommendations team focuses on personalized music suggestions. A search \u0026 discovery team helps users to find new music. Complicated Subsystem Teams Complicated subsystem teams take responsibility for software areas where significant expertise is required. Their goal is to provide a specialized subsystem to other teams and help them reduce their team cognitive load.\nExamples could be:\nA licensing management team handles the complexities of content licensing and availability. A streaming optimization team improves the quality of music streaming. A metadata processing team enriches and standardizes song metadata. Enabling Teams Enabling teams are helping other teams to close knowledge gaps or adopt new technologies.\nFor example:\nA UX research team coaches other teams in qualitative research methods. Compliance support team: ensures adherence to copyright laws and regulations. Data science team: assists with data models for recommendations and AI products. Platform Teams A crucial insight of Team Topologies is that the primary benefit of a platform is to reduce the cognitive load on stream-aligned teams. (Martin Fowler)\nPlatform teams provide tools and services for other teams. They act as internal service providers.\nExamples are:\nAn identity \u0026 access management team develops a central authentication solution for the entire organization. Streaming infrastructure team: provides the backend systems for scalable audio streaming. Data platform team: develops a centralized data warehouse and pipelines for analytics. The Three Interaction Modes in Team Topologies In addition to the team types, there are three modes how teams can efficiently interact.\nWith examples how the four music streaming team types could interact with each other.\nCollaboration Mode Teams collaborate closely to solve a specific challenge.\nFor example, a stream-aligned search \u0026 discovery team collaborates with a complicated subsystem metadata processing team to show personalized search results based on user behavior.\nFacilitating Mode One team supports another team without directly engaging in its tasks. Facilitation is particularly useful for sharing knowledge or improving workflows.\nFor example, the data science team provides expertise on implementing new recommendation models to a stream aligned recommendations team.\nX-as-a-Service Mode One team provides standardized tools or services that other teams can use in an x-as-a-service manner.\nFor example: a streaming infrastructure team provides APIs and backend infrastructure for streaming services to all stream-aligned teams.\nPutting It All Together This is what a team setup with all 4 team types and 3 interaction modes could look like:\nPossible Further Developments of the Model Team Topologies works very well with a limited number of teams and interactions. However, when it comes to representing large organizations with dependencies between numerous teams, things quickly become confusing.\nA visualization similar to AWS groups/containers in AWS architecture diagrams could be a solution to represent related sections as such and to connect them with other sections.\nReferences Team Topologies, Matthew Skelton \u0026 Manuel Pais https://github.com/TeamTopologies/miro-team-topologies https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html ","wordCount":"636","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-01-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Simon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/topologies/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Simon Schreiber | Product Management Consultant","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Team Topologies in a Nutshell</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 10, 2025</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>With Team Topologies, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais aim to reduce the complexity of tech organizations to four team types and three modes of interaction.</p><blockquote><p>The end goal is to help teams produce software that aligns with customer needs and is easier to build, run, and own.

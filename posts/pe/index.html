Joel Spolsky on the Worst Possible Strategic Mistake
Joel Spolsky is one of the co-founders of Stack Overflow. Although he has hardly posted on &ldquo;Joel on Software&rdquo; for years, there are several timeless articles worth reading. One of them is “Things You Should Never Do, Part I” from 2000. It is about a specific strategic mistake in the tech industry and why the cause lies in the rule of thumb that code is harder to read than to write."><meta name=author content="Simon"><link rel=canonical href=https://www.sischreiber.com/posts/pe/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.fc220c15db4aef0318bbf30adc45d33d4d7c88deff3238b23eb255afdc472ca6.css integrity="sha256-/CIMFdtK7wMYu/MK3EXTPU18iN7/MjiyPrJVr9xHLKY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://www.sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://www.sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://www.sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://www.sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico><link rel=mask-icon href=https://www.sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://www.sischreiber.com/posts/pe/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-YF40GW2FXK"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-YF40GW2FXK")</script><meta property="og:title" content="6 Timeless Product Insights From Engineering Leaders"><meta property="og:description" content="Software engineers don’t go to product managers to understand how to build a software application.

It is about a specific strategic mistake in the tech industry and why the cause lies in the rule of thumb that code is harder to read than to write.\n„The Only Thing That Matters“ From Marc Andreessen Marc Andreessen is a software engineer and co-founder of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm a16z. In the 1990s he co-developed the browser pioneers Mosaic and Netscape. The essence of his article is that achieving product-market fit is “the only thing that matters” – even before the team or the product itself.\n„A Big Ball of Mud“ A Big Ball of Mud is a software application that has no recognizable architecture: “haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle”. Product managers should ask themselves to what extent they are indirectly responsible for this kind of anti-pattern through time pressure for quick results, feature creep or a lack of product vision. Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder coined the term in 1999 (large PDF).\nWhen Paul Graham Recommends to “Do Things That Don’t Scale” Paul Graham, a computer scientist and co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, emphasizes the importance of focusing on labor-intensive, unscalable tasks in the early stages of a startup or product. Like manually recruiting users or even assembling hardware yourself. Automation can always come later. These early, manual efforts “That Don’t Scale” often instill principles that stay even after the scaling phase, like a relentless focus on customer acquisition.\nPatterns in “Super Successful Companies” Sam Altman is a co-founder of OpenAI, software engineer, entrepreneur and investor. Many of the thoughts he wrote down in 2014 focus on founders in the early stages of a startup. However, as you read the article, it quickly becomes clear that these insights seem to be applicable to any phase and size of a company aiming to build a great product.\nWhen Martin Fowler Recommends Feeling Pain in Agile Software Development Martin Fowler helped to create the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. In 2008, he described a central characteristic of agile software development in under 200 words: Identifying problems early and thus having more time to solve them. In contrast to waterfall, where problems are postponed until they are very painful to solve. This approach is almost universally applicable in agile development, whether in 2008 or today.\n","wordCount":"473","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.sischreiber.com/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Simon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.sischreiber.com/posts/pe/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Simon Schreiber | Product Management Consultant","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.sischreiber.com/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.sischreiber.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.sischreiber.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.sischreiber.com/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.sischreiber.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.sischreiber.com/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Timeless Product Insights From Engineering Leaders</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-10-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 31, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Software engineers don’t go to product managers to understand how to build a software application.

Rather than owning deliverables, it collaborates with stream-aligned or platform teams to build their capabilities. This approach allows AI knowledge to spread without central dependencies.\nPlatform Team (for AI Infrastructure) The platform team builds and maintains internal AI infrastructure that can be reused across the organization. This includes APIs for model access or prompt management systems. The platform exists to reduce cognitive load for product teams while ensuring alignment with org standards.\nStream-Aligned Teams (with Clear AI Use Cases) These teams own a user-facing product and apply AI to solve concrete problems within that context. They operate autonomously while getting support from enabling and platform teams. AI is not the goal but a means to deliver better outcomes.\nComplicated Subsystem Team (for Advanced AI Components) When an organization deals with technically complex AI components, a dedicated complicated subsystem team may be required. Examples include recommendation systems or self-hosted large language models with custom training pipelines. These teams focus on deep expertise while maintaining long-term ownership of AI components.\n","wordCount":"273","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-06-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-06-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Simon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-org/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Simon Schreiber | Product Management Consultant","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Simon Schreiber (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Simon Schreiber</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Organizing for AI: Structures That Scale</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-06-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 25, 2025</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>The challenge with AI isn’t just the technology.
